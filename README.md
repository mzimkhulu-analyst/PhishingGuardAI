# PhishingGuardAI
PhishingGuardAI is a tool that detects phishing emails in real-time by combining a fine-tuned BERT-based model for classification with a RAG pipeline for contextual analysis. It processes email streams via Kafka, serves predictions through a FastAPI endpoint, and is packaged in a Docker container.
